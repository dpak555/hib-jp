# Hibernate workshop examples
Bit and bobs that I use to run a JPA/Hibernate workshop. The code uses maven and Spring to run the 
example mappings

## What is included in the tin?
Nothing too wild
* One to One
* One to Many / Many to One 
* Many to Many
* Embedded
* Secondary table
* Inheritance
* Lazy fetching
* Queries
    * JPQL
    * Named queries
    * Spring Data
    * Native SQL
* Optimistic locking
* Composite keys (in progress)


## TODO
* Add more examples of composite keys
* Add examples of ternary keys
* The two above with mixed with associations
* User types (including user types for Id fields)
* Caching
* Examples of bad TX management with Spring
* Examples of bad equals/hashcode
* Examples of slow queries (eg. 'ignore case')
